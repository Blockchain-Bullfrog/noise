# TODO

1) A lot of performance optimizations

2) Generalising to n dimensions

3) abstracting the interpolation method (strategy pattern)

4) ongoing additions of noise types and builders with adjustable parameters for easy building.

5) Implement a way to make noise go on forever (Limit amount of gridpoints in memory) such that it becomes possible to stream (sort of). How far we can go depends on the data type.
